Source code:
  1. speech_recog2.py: contains different speech recognition API's, but primarily uses Google's Speech API. This checks that the speech API can detect words and also contains simple inventory management.

Design: If the microphone picks up sound and Google's API can translate it into a word that is the valid word bank, it will be added to the player's inventory

Bugs: No bugs, this was just a simple testing program.

Plans: There are no further plans to expand this. This was just used for test purposes and it has been implemented into the main game where further plans were made for those files.
